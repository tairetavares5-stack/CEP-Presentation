# CEP146-NCC - 2026 Winter - Project I

## Objective
In a group, students will research and present (via a short video) a recent or ongoing current topic/event related to software development. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of contemporary topics, improve research and communication skills, and utilize GitHub for collaborative project development and material organization.

## Due Date
- Pleae keep the README.md file continuously up-to-date if you add/delete group members
- Presentations are due before the start of class on **February 12**

## Project Requirements

| Item                    | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Topic**               | Any **current** topic related to **software development/programming** (e.g., new programming languages, software engineering trends, major software company news, or emerging tools). Do not choose an AI-related or hardware-related topic. |
| **Team Size**           | 3–4 students per group. |
| **Presentation Format** | Pre-recorded **YouTube video** (Time: **2:30–3:00 minutes** - Note that 3:00 minutes is a **hard limit** and submissions over the limit will be rejected!) |
| **Presentation Style**  | Freestyle: Use any method (e.g., live recording, PowerPoint voiceover, screen recording) <br>**Note**: Do not use AI-generated voices or video |
| **GitHub Use**          | All project work (scripts, slides, media assets, documentation, etc.) must be uploaded to **GitHub**. Collaboration history (including commits and issues) will be assessed during project marking |
| **Attribution**         | All referenced sources must be cited in your video and in a list of references document inside your repository, using a standard format (such as APA or MLA) |
| **Discussion**          | The presentation must include a final discussion question. After the video is presented, a designated member of your group must facilitate a 2-5 minute class discussion based on that discussion question |
| **Grading Breakdown**   | Total: **10% of final grade**, consisting of 8 marks for the Presentation + GitHub collaboration, and 2 marks for the selection of the discussion question and the facilitation of the discussion |

## Deliverables Checklist

All items must be committed via the group’s GitHub repository, :

- [ ]  Main README.md file, containing a table with four columns and one row per student in the group: Full Name, Seneca E-mail address, and GitHub User ID
- [ ] Research notes or draft write-up
- [ ] Video script or outline
- [ ] Visual slide deck(s) (if used)
- [ ] Reference list document
- [ ] Discussion question and preparation for facilitation of discussion (e.g., ideas to promote discussion, responses to possible issues raised during discussion)
- [ ] Final video YouTube link (place this in the main README.md file)
- [ ] Evidence of collaboration (issues, commits, etc.)
- [ ] Evidence of participation of each member of the group (for example, via commit history and Issue creation and comments)

## Grading (Total 10%)

### Group Presentation – 8%

- **Topic selection, content accuracy, and depth**: Topic is relevant, well-researched, and reflects understanding of the current event or issue in software development.
- **Clarity & Creativity of Presentation**: Video is engaging, within time limit, and delivery is clear.
- **GitHub Usage & Collaboration**: Good use of GitHub (commits from all members, readme, reference list, issues, collaboration). Evidence of shared work.
- **Structure**: Clear structure (intro-body-conclusion)
- **Technical Quality (Editing & Delivery)**: Video/audio is clear and watchable. Not overly dependent on one speaker. Good pacing.

### Facilitation of Discussion - 2%
- **Well-chosen discussion question**: Question is clear, open-ended, and thought-provoking
- **Preparation for discussion**: Group has considered possible discussion directions and considered appropriate responses
- **Facilitation of discussion**: Lively discussion is encouraged, discussion is steered appropriately

## Suggestions for Topics

- Programming language trends
- Rise of low-code/no-code platforms
- Major cybersecurity incidents

## GitHub Best Practices for the Project

- Use the `README.md` file as an index/guide to the other files in the repository. Make sure it includes at least:
  - The table of students
  - Link to YouTube video
  - Link to the document containing a list of references
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks (e.g., script writing, editing, voiceover)
- Use folders to organize different types of assets (scripts, graphics, and so forth).
- Assign roles clearly and document contributions, via commits and Issues (including comments on Issues).
- Commit and push regularly – avoid a single last-minute upload.
- Create branches (optionally, use pull requests) as appropriate.

---

## Submission Format

- GitHub repository with all project materials.
- Public (but possibly Unlisted) YouTube video link embedded in the `README.md`
